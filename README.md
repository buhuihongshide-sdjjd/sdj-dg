### What is this?

This is a project that enables you to generate data for your topics more quickly.

### How to use this?

First, modify the code in the work function of answer.cpp and generate.cpp.

The work function in generate.cpp is used to generate input data, while the work function in answer.cpp is used to output the expected results for the input data generated by the generate.cpp.

You can use the script to build and run the container(please ensure that you are not running any containers)

```
./dk.sh
```

Or if you want to run on your local computer, you can run 

```
./local.sh
```

After the operation is completed, you will find an additional file named data.zip in your folder, which is the data file. The default name for the data is "data", which means that the input file is data<x>.in and the answer file is data<x>.ans, where x is a number. When the x of the input file matches the x of the answer file, it indicates that this is a corresponding set of data.
